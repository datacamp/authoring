# Projects

## Getting started

In order to start creating projects your Curriculum Lead (CL) is going to create initial [project structure](README.md#repository-structure) for you.  
Once the project has been created you will need to pull the contents of the repository by using your Github account.

When project data is present on your work environment you can use Jupyter notebook to open the `project.ipynb` and start working on your project. 

## Repository Structure {#repository-structure}

Projects use a simple directory structure.

```text
|- README.md\*
|- project.yml\*
|- project.ipynb\*
|- datasets/
|- img/
|- requirements.sh
|- notebooks/
```

An overview of each file/folder is provided below.

| `datasets`             | YAML key value combinations that explicitly define the datasets that are used in this course.

If the value is,`__IGNORE__`, the dataset won't be shown on the course page | optional |

Properties which require additional explanation are:

##### prerequisites

As previously mentioned prerequisites contain a list of course id's which are the prerequisite for the course. An example on how to specify those in the `course.yml` is:

```yaml
prerequisites:
  - 58 # Introduction to R
  - 672 # Intermediate R
```

##### datasets

As previously mentioned datasets is a list of datasets used in the course. All the datasets are going to be visible on the course page (page which is seen by students) unless you ignore the files which shouldn't be visible. You can ignore files in the `course.yml` by using `__IGNORE__` as follows:

```yaml
datasets:
  some_data.RData: Super nice dataset
  some_image.jpg: Some image
  r_script_i_need.R: __IGNORE__ # This file won't be shown on the course page
```

> #### info::Note
> to make your life easier, there's an automated system that will add the datasets in your datasets directory to your course.yml. The system will try to generate a humanized string, you can change it afterwards (or change it to `__IGNORE__` if you want the system to ignore this dataset). To trigger it, you'll see a button in the build status block of your course, in the Home tab.

You may have noticed that`language` and `technology` are both required regardless of specifying similar data. This is due to legacy reasons and could be subject to change in upcoming versions.

### `project.ipynb`
This while should be created by using the Jupyter notebook. DataCamp will read contents of the file and create the project for your students.
