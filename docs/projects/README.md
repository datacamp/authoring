DataCamp Projects
=======================

A DataCamp Project is an exciting new teaching format that allow students to flex their skills when completing an applied data science task. A Project consists of a code notebook that describes an analysis / case study / data narrative, but where the code has been partially removed. It is now up to the student to complete the Project, with the help of instructions and hints.

If you've never seen a DataCamp project then you'll quickly get the gist by watching this intro video:

Overview of Projects documentation
------------------------------------------

- If you don't know where to start, you should check out the [Project Creation Process](projects-process.md). There you'll find out what you need to create a Project, and what the different steps are.
<!-- - DataCamp Projects are authored as Jupyter notebooks and the first step is to create the analysis / case study / data narrative the Project is centered around. To do this you need to know about the [Narrative notebook format](projects-narrative-format.md). -->
- The [Project notebook format](projects-format.md) defines how the final Jupyter notebook describing a DataCamp Project should look.
- The Project notebook needs to reside in a GitHub repository to be published on DataCamp. The [Project File Structure page](projects-repo-structure.md) describes the file structure of the project repository.
