# Vision

Before starting to write a project, it is very important to start with the vision statement, and understand it.

> Projects should allow learners to take the skills they have learnt and apply it to an end-to-end analysis on a real-world **task**, using real-world **tools** and **workflows,** and **showcase** their work.

### Tasks

Projects should be based on real-world content and allow a learner to work on tasks a data scientist is expected to encounter in their daily work. They also need to be end-to-end, allowing the learner to work through the complete data science lifecycle, starting from raw data and ending in interesting insights that can be communicated.

### Tools

Projects should let the user make use of real-world tools like Rstudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio etc. The idea is to make it easier for them to transition from courses to working on a real-world data science project.

### Workflow

Projects should allow the user to experience the same workflow that they are likely to encounter while working on a real-world data science project. This implies being able to work locally, installing requirements, working with a version control system etc.

### Showcase

Users should be able to showcase their work and build a portfolio that they can share with prospective employers.
