### Preview

It's always handy to see how your content is going to look like before publishing it to your students. By using preview you can make sure that the content and exercises are behaving as expected before pushing the content to your students.

## Handling content

With the Teach Editor, you edit markdown files that are also on GitHub. While using the editor, a version of the file is kept on the Teach Editor server. 

This means that when you accidentally close your browser window, your changes will not be lost. They're saved to our Teach Editor server! However they will be thrown away after two days. So if you're done working, it's always best to save your progress to GitHub.
