*Create content dialog*

When creating the content you will be using the Create content dialog which consists of:

- **Dropdown** where you can select on which Github account you want to create the repository from (*Useful when you have more than 1 organization connected to your account*)
- **Name** of the course you are creating
- **Link existing github repository** is an option where DataCamp is going to fetch the names of all your Github repositories and offer you the possibility to import those repositories as courses. (*In order to work your Github repository should contain [structure](../courses/data-structure.md) DataCamp build process understands)

Once "Create" button has been clicked DataCamp is going to create the scaffolded course on which you can continue working. We recommend checking the [Exercises page](../courses/exercises/README.md) on best way to continue authoring your content.
