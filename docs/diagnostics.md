# Content diagnostics
Once you have successfully [created](/courses/README.md) and [built](/interface/content-overview.md#build-information) a course a set of diagnostics messages are going to be available for you in [content overview panel](/interface/content-overview.md) under "Maintenance".

Diagnostic rules are DataCamp recommendations for keeping content consistent and ensuring quality.

## Diagnostics
All the diagnostics are being done on three different levels being **Course**, **Chapter** and **Exercise** where each diagnostic message will have a level of importance such as `warning` or `info` along with information to which exercise type the diagnostic is valid for.
