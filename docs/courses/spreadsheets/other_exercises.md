# Other Exercises

Until now we talked about regular exercises. These have the type `NormalExercise` internally,
but you don't have to define this as it's the default. The type of an exercise can be controlled
in the meta sheet, using the `type` field. There are 3 other types:

* [`VideoExercise`](other_exercises/video.md)
* [`PureMultipleChoiceExercise`](other_exercises/pure-multiple-choice.md)
* [`MultipleChoiceExercise`](other_exercises/multiple-choice.md)
