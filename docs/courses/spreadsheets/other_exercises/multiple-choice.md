# Multiple Choice Exercises

For the multiple choice exercise, add a [meta sheet](../exercises/meta.md) and add the
field `type` with value `MultipleChoiceExercise`.

A multiple choice exercise works exactly the same as a
[`PureMultipleChoiceExercise`](pure-multiple-choice.md), except for the fact that the
user will also get a workbook to experiment in. The meta sheet is exactly the same
as for a pure multiple choice exercise. However, for this exercise type you can also
add a solution and sample sheet. You can **not** define an SCT sheet for this exercise
type.
