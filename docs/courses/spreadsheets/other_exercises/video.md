# Video Exercises

For the video exercise, add a [meta sheet](../exercises/meta.md) and add the field
`type` with value `VideoExercise`.

Only a meta sheet is required for a video exercise. The following fields can be defined:

* **type**: needs to be set to `VideoExercise`
* **title**: the title of the exercise
* **projector_key**: the projector key of the video. This can be found on GitHub, at the top
  of the slide markdown file you created using the Teach Editor. **Watch out**: this key needs
  to be prepended by `course_{course_id}_{projector_key}`. For example for the [first slide of
  pivot tables](https://github.com/datacamp/courses-pivot-tables-with-google-sheets/blob/master/slides/chapter_1_video_1.md),
  this would be `course_7268_610fb633cdafa6bc78c1cd12f6183b44`.

You can then create videos using the [usual video creation process](../../exercises/video-exercises/slides.md),
using the Teach Editor.

Remember, there is no sample, solution or SCT sheet for video exercises.
