## Limitations

Limitations currently include:

* Some things are not preserved over exercises and need to be in the Golden Copy. For example:
  * Conditional formatting
  * Merged cells
  * Dropdown menus in cells
* Named Ranges are not preserved (even over the Golden Copy), so should be avoided.
* Tweaks might have to be made to `check_chart` or `check_pivot`. Make sure to add what you
  need to the Tech Blockers issue of your course.
