# General

Exercises are built inside the [**workbook
source**](../workbooks.md) of a workbook. Each normal exercise consists of 4 separate sheets:
**Meta**, **Sample**, **Solution** and **SCT**. More details on each of these is provided in
this section.

The exercise sheets must follow a strict naming convention, sensitive to caps and spaces:

```
Exercise <exercise_number> - <Meta|Sample|Solution|SCT>
```

The exercise numbers must be adding up starting with `Exercise 1 - ...`, then `Exercise
2 - ...`, and so on.

As an example, here is a workbook source that has 2 exercises:

As you can see, a workbook with 2 exercises has 9 sheets associated with it: 4 for each exercise and
one extra for the Golden Copy. This workbook source results in the
