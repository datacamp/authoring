# Courses

Course consists of series of videos, slides, and different types of exercises. Each course combines brief lectures with hands-on coding and other exercises.

## Creating a Course

In order to create a course make sure you are signed in to your [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) account.
Once you are signed in, go to [DataCamp for Teachers](https://www.datacamp.com/teach).

_[DataCamp for Teachers - Dashboard](/interface/dashboard.md)_ 

To create a new course, click the "Add Course +" button.  The following dialog will appear:

Give your course a `name` and specify the technology it will use (one of R, Python, SQL, or Shell). Names must be all lower-case with dashes instead of spaces; when you are done, click "Create".  We prefer courses to be named as follows:

* Avoid an `Introduction to` prefix.
* Use an `in R/Python/SQL` suffix whenever possible.
* Please keep names shorter than 50 characters.
* Be as specific as possible.
* Use [title case](http://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/capital_letters_title_case.htm).
* Avoid terms that are locale-specific (i.e., 'Stats 101' doesn't mean anything to people outside the US).
* Avoid abbreviations like 'datavis'.
* For multi-part courses, use `Course Title (Part 1)`, etc.

> #### info::NOTE
> Creating the course can take a few moments.

Once the course has been created it will appear in your Dashboard:
