# Courses

Course consists of series of videos, slides, and different types of exercises. Each course combines brief lectures with hands-on coding and other exercises.

## Creating a course

In order to create a course make sure you are signed in to your [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) account.
Once you are signed in, go to [DataCamp for Teachers](https://www.datacamp.com/teach).

To create a new course, click the "Add Course +" button.  The following dialog will appear:

Give your course a `name` and specify the technology it will use (one of R, Python, SQL, or Shell). Names must be all lower-case with dashes instead of spaces, such as `best-course`.  When you are done, click "Create".

> #### info::NOTE
> Creating the course can take a few moments.

Once the course has been created it will appear in your Dashboard:

Congratulations–you just created your first course!

### What just happened?

Here's what happened behind the scenes when you clicked "Create":

1.  DataCamp created a course populated with scaffolded exercises and information.
2.  The course was uploaded to your Github account in a new repository named `best-course`.
    (You can check this by going to your account on GitHub and looking for that repository.)
