# Learner Personas

Terms like "beginner" and "expert" mean different things to different people,
so we use personas help instructors clarify a course's audience.
When designing a specific course,
instructors should explain how it will or won't help these people,
and what extra skills or prerequisite knowledge they are assuming their students have
above and beyond what's included in the persona.

Note: these personas mention some specific technologies or domains,
such as Python or epidemiology.
When using these personas,
replace these by equivalent levels of knowledge about technologies or domains appropriate to your course,
e.g.,
novice understanding of R but advanced understanding of medical imaging
(or vice versa).

## Advanced Alex

- Age: 34
- Location: Reno, Nevada, USA
- Education: Bachelor in Mathematics and Master in Finance & Risk Management - University of Nevada
- Personal: Interested in teaching courses himself some day.

**Previous Jobs**

- Pricing analyst for power distributor.
- Financial analyst at Bank of America.

**Current Job**

- Head quantitative analyst in small hedge fund.

**Career Goal**

After developing his skill set and finding out what he likes in
previous jobs, Alex is set on staying in this role for quite a
while. He was recently made part of the management team. His main
concern is driving the company forward and outpacing competitors.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Having touched the basics of data science in his education, Alex is
currently using Python in his job. To get better and improve his
business' competitive edge, he went looking for more Python skills.
Google and forums led him to try edX and DataCamp. DataCamp's renowned
instructors and the fact that respected institutions use it pulled
Alex in. Today, he uses DataCamp as his first foundational resource
and supplements it with specific, more in depth courses on Coursera.

**DataCamp Experience**

The main draw for Alex is that DataCamp brings him high-level
understanding of what's out there in the data science field, on pace
with the new developments. He doesn't mind shopping around for more
specific and in-depth content, but could see this becoming a bit
annoying in the future. In any case, the business value of DataCamp
for him lies in the apply fast way the learning experience is set up.

> From a business perspective, I need to be able to apply the data
> science I learn straight away - I can't afford to first spend 3
> months learning without being able to apply.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Such a fast moving field
  (focusing on the right data science subjects).
- So many views and approaches
  (having the right take on certain topics)
- Getting data science to really work for him
  (how to apply and build business value).

## Starting Sindhu

- Age: 28
- Location: Bangalore, Karnataka, India
- Education: Bachelor in Biochemistry, Master in Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry - University of Mumbai
- Personal: Likes things she can do on the move (e.g., podcasts).

**Previous Jobs**

- Chemist at waste recycling company.

**Current Job**

- Scientist at Merck & Co pharmaceuticals.

**Career Goal**

Sindhu works in a team of scientists researching the effectiveness of
vaccines. She invests a lot of time in clearly presenting and
reporting her results to their superiors. She is constantly looking
for better ways of doing so and hopes to one day become the principal
scientist on her team this way.

**Data Science Education Experience**

SIndhu came out of university with knowledge about the most important
statistical concepts and techniques. However, needing to visualise a
lot of her findings, Sindhu quickly found that nor Excel and JMP - the
tools used in her team - nor SPSS - the software used in university -
were as customizable as she would have liked. Moreover, she lost a lot
of time building her model from scratch each time.  A quick survey
among research scientist friends led her to R and DataCamp.  After two
free courses and the relief that it was actually doable, Sindhu
subscribed.

**DataCamp Experience**

Expecting a steep and long learning curve, Sindhu was pleasantly
surprised to see how fast DataCamp made her put her hands on the
keyboard to code herself.  These quick exercises and immediate
feedback still are what keeps Sindhu motivated and thinking she can
actually do this. The tracks and the fact that DataCamp is well
curated and has things in one place are a big plus for her as
well. She misses being able to easily export the code so she can keep
it with the slides.

> I was surprised to see how you had to code from the get go. As a
> chemist with no data science background, this made all the
> difference in giving me confidence.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Whether she'll be able to get it
  (steep and long learning curve of data science).
- Where to start
  (which language and which skills or topics).

## Coder Chen

- Age: 42
- Location: Calgary, Alberta, Canada
- Education: Bachelor of Computer Science - University of Saskatchewan
- Personal: Highly motivated by the social side of learning.

**Previous Jobs**

- E-commerce application developer.
- Software project manager.
- Co-founder of software development consultancy (acquired by farm machinery firm).

**Current Job**

- VP of software development, Lewis Agricultural.

**Career Goal**

Chen is responsible for a group of 30 programmers developing software
for next-generation farm machinery. Her team is now responsible for
developing applications that will help customers analyze and
understand the large volumes of data being collected by sensors placed
in the field and on their equipment.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Chen has a strong programming background, but has never taken a
statistics course, and her data visualization experience is limited to
creating budget reports for management in Excel.  Knowing that she
needed to learn some basic statistics in order to do her job, she
asked one of the company's financial team to recommend some online
courses.  This led her to DataCamp, and after working through a
handful of courses on R, she has now purchased six seats for her team
members to use as well.

**DataCamp Experience**

Chen was originally worried that her lack of mathematical background
would make it hard for her to work through courses in the time she
had.  She was quickly reassured by the way that lessons move in small,
digestible steps, and by the way that the interactive interface let
her tinker with code as she went along.

> I originally started this because my job required it, but I
> discovered that I was enjoying learning something new.  I
> particularly like discussion on the Slack channel with people doing
> so many different things.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Whether she has the necessary mathematics background
  (and whether she can fill in the gaps in the time she can afford to invest).

## Unaware Umberto

- Age: 27
- Location: London, UK
- Education: Bachelor in Philosophy & Bachelor in Business  Economics - King's College London
- Personal: Partially deaf, so prefers materials with closed captioning.

**Previous Job**

- Financial advisor at Lloyds Banking Group.

**Current Job**

- Financial analyst at KPMG.

**Data Science Education Experience**

Having only worked with excel and some SPSS in his studies, Umberto
learned most of the modelling and analysis techniques on the job. The
managers he worked with so far in his projects used Excel and custom
KPMG tools, and he hasn't been in touch with data science tools as of
now.  He thus doesn't know about them or how they could help him yet.
However, Umberto is constantly looking for easier and more efficient
ways of doing his job tasks-at-hand to move up in his demanding
career.

**DataCamp Experience**

Umberto doesn't know DataCamp. 

**Career Goal**

Having a not-so-common education background, Umberto is set on
learning as much as possible working in consultancy for many different
clients. He loves the on the job trainings and wants to build
knowledge so he can grow into a project lead role. In the future, he
sees himself as lead analyst for a food import/export company.

> Building analytical reasonings and spreadsheet models from scratch
> is what I like and spend most of my time at work doing.

**Is Uncertain About…**
     
- Doing things correctly and efficiently.
- Growing as fast as his colleagues.
