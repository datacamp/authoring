# Exercises

Every course is organized into chapters consisting of one or more exercises.  If you created a course repository through [www.datacamp.com/teach](https://www.datacamp.com/teach), your chapter files will already contain some DataCamp exercises to start from.

DataCamp supports variety of different exercises, each of which consists of several blocks.  Some types of blocks are used by many exercises, while others are exercise-specific.  Whenever possible, choose a coding exercise over a non-coding exercise: people come to us for hands-on instruction, and having them use what they're learning right away improves retention.

Whatever types of exercises you choose, it is essential that they be *reproducible*: anyone with the right software must be able to re-run them and get the answer that you expect.  The "anyones" you must initially satisfy are your Curriculum Lead, our Curriculum Developers (who will be in charge of final edits and of deploying your course), and our automated back end (which must be able to run your code and its correcntess tests unsupervised).  This requirement means that it isn't practical to use live data feeds in exercises, since their contents may change outside your control.  Instead, you should always rely on archived datasets (either those included with the packages you are teaching or those you have explicitly included in your lesson).

## Exercise Types {#exercise-types}

These types of exercises are currently supported:

| Type                                                                 | Description |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| [`VideoExercise`](video-exercise.md)                                 | Displays a video exercise |
| [`NormalExercise`](normal-exercise)                                  | Instructions, exercise, code editor, and console |
| [`MultipleChoiceExercise`](multiple-choice-exercise.md)              | Multiple choice question and console |
| [`PureMultipleChoiceExercise`](multiple-choice-exercise.md#pure-mce) | Multiple choice question without a console |
| [`TabExercise`](tab-exercise.md)                                     | A series of connected sub-exercises |
| [`BulletExercise`](bullet-exercise.md)                               | A series of connected sub-exercises |   

### Exercise Header {#exercise-header}

Each exercise has a header consisting of a `title` block and a YAML properties defining the exercise:

{% codetabs name="Video", type="py" -%}
## Video Exercise

```yaml
type: VideoExercise 
lang: r
xp: 50 
video_link: //player.vimeo.com/video/160339466
video_hls: //videos.datacamp.com/transcoded/672_intermediate_r/v2/hls-ch1_1.master.m3u8
```
{%- language name="Normal", type="py" -%}
## Interactive Exercise Title

```yaml

```
{%- language name="MultipleChoice", type="py" -%}
## When to use Python?

```yaml

```
{%- language name="PureMultipleChoice", type="py" -%}
## Example of PureMultipleChoiceExercise

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
lang: python

```
{%- endcodetabs %}

## Exercise properties {#exercise-properties}

The supported properties differ depending on the type of the exercise:

| Block          | Video              | Normal             | MultipleChoice     | PureMultipleChoice  |

| `aspect_ratio` | :white_check_mark: | :x:                | :x:                | :x:                 |

- `type`: type of the exercise you are creating as listed in [Exercise Types](README.md#exercise-types).
- `key`: a unique key for the exercise generated by DataCamp. Do not modify or duplicate this key.
- `lang`: the language of the exercise (`r`, `python`, `sql`, or `shell`).
- `xp`: the XP the student will receive for solving the exercise.
- `video_link`: a link to the video for a `VideoExercise`.
- `aspect_ratio`: the aspect ration for a `VideoExercise`.

## Exercise blocks {#exercise-blocks}

Exercises may contain the following kinds of blocks:

| Block               | Video              | Normal             | MultipleChoice     | PureMultipleChoice |

> #### info::Note
> `TabExercise` and `BulletExercise` are not included in the comparison table because they are combinations of other exercise types.

- `title`: title of the exercise shown to students taking the course.
- `assignment`: describes the task the student is to solve.
- `instructions`: the actual question or task for the student. In the case of a `MultipleChoiceExercise`, the instructions list the options from which the student can choose.
- `hint`: a hint the student can request.
- `pre_exercise_code`: code run in the background when the exercise is loaded to load necessary libraries, define variables, etc.
- `sample_code`: starter code made available to the user at the beginning of the exercise.
- `solution`: a correct solution to an interactive exercise.  DataCamp's back end runs this code when building the course to check that the exercise's submission tests run correctly.
- `sct`: the exercise's submission correctness tests (described below).
- `video_link`: the link to the video (`VideoExercise` only).
- `aspect_ratio`: the aspect ratio (`VideoExercise` only).
- `possible_answers`: a list of possible answers and a correct answer (`PureMultipleChoiceExercise` only). See [How to create PureMultipleChoiceExercise](multiple-choice-exercise.md#pure-mce) for details.
- `feedbacks`: a list with feedback for each possible answer (`PureMultipleChoiceExercise` only). See [How to create PureMultipleChoiceExercise](multiple-choice-exercise.md#pure-mce) for details.

### Submission correctness tests (SCTs)

`NormalExercise` and `MultipleChoiceExercise` require you to write *Submission Correctness Tests* (SCTs) to assess whether the student gave the correct answer. Writing good SCTs is challenging, so DataCamp has developed technology-specific packages to simplify the task:

| Language | Source                                               | Documentation |
