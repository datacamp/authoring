# Exercises

As we have learned when examining the [course data structure](../data-structure.md) the content of a course is organized into chapters, each of which consists of one or more exercises.

The three most commonly used exercise types are:

<!--
__MultipleChoiceExercise__

 Provides the student with a set of possible answers. Based on the exercise information and the instruction, the student is expected to select one (and only one) answer. During a multiple choice exercise, the user can still experiment in the R console.


A full list of all exercise types supported by the platform is provided below. -->
