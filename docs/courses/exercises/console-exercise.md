# Console Exercise

![Console Exercise - Shell](/images/ConsoleExerciseShell.png)

A `ConsoleExercise` only features a console. Typing a command in the console and hitting `Enter` submits the answer, and the backend provides feedback. This is currently available only for Shell courses.

### Example
