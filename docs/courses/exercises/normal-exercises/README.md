# Normal Exercise

A `NormalExercise` gives students some background information and instructions, then checks the code they submit and provides feedback.  The exercise and instructions are shown on the left, the code editor in the top right, and an interactive console for experimentation in the bottom right.  Code is executed in two processes/environments so that you can safely compare objects in them in the submission correctness tests.

Information regarding the exercise or the dataset is stated in the `assignment` part; the actual task the student has to solve is outlined in the `instructions`. Behind the scenes, the workspace is prepared for the studentâ€™s actions using the `pre_exercise_code`. The student starts to code in an editor initialized with the `sample_code`. When the student is not able to solve the exercise, they can refer to the `hint` or look at the `solution`. Every time the student clicks the "Submit Code" button, their code is checked using the Submission Correctness Testing code (`sct`), which generates a feedback message.

## Example

This chapter contains one `NormalExercise` for R.  Each block is described in detail following the example.

    ## Normal Exercise Title

    ```yaml
    type: NormalExercise
    lang: r
    xp: 100
    ```

    This basic exercise will challenge you to assign a variable in R.

    `@instructions`
    - Assign `5` to the variable `x` in the editor on the right.

    `@hint`
    Use `<-` for assignment.

    `@pre_exercise_code`
    ```{r}
    y <- 3
    ```

    `@sample_code`
    ```{r}
    # Assign 5 to the variable x
    ```

    `@solution`
    ```{r}
    # Assign 5 to the variable x
    x <- 5
    ```

    `@sct`
    ```{r}
    ex() %>% check_error()
    ex() %>% check_object("x") %>% check_equal()
    success_msg("Awesome! It's considered good style to write spaces either side of the assignment arrow.")
    ```

## Context

A `NormalExercise` starts with `## Title`, followed by a `metadata` block and a context block that describes the exercise.

    ## Normal Exercise Title

    ```yaml
    type: NormalExercise
    lang: r
    xp: 100
    ```

    This basic exercise will challenge you to assign a variable in R.

## Instructions

    `@instructions`
    - Assign `5` to the variable `x` in the editor on the right.

## Hints

    `@hint`
    Use `<-` for assignment.

## Pre Exercise Code

    `@pre_exercise_code`
    ```{r}
    y <- 3
    ```

## Sample Code

    `@sample_code`
    ```{r}
    # Assign 5 to the variable x
    ```

## Solution

    `@solution`
    ```{r}
    # Assign 5 to the variable x
    x <- 5
    ```

## Submission Correctness Tests (SCT)

    `@sct`
    ```{r}
    ex() %>% check_error()
    ex() %>% check_object("x") %>% check_equal()
    success_msg("Awesome! It's considered good style to write spaces either side of the assignment arrow.")
    ```
