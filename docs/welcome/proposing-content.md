# Proposing a Project or Course

Here at DataCamp,
we recognize that our community knows a lot more than we ever will,
so we are always open to proposals for new courses or projects.
If you would like to propose something:

1. Have a look at our current projects and courses to see if there's any overlap with existing content.

2. Skim [our course design description](../courses/design/)
   and [our project creation description](../projects/projects-process.html)
   and decide which you think would be a better fit for what you'd like to teach.

3. If you want to create a course,
   write a single-paragraph course description like [the examples given here](../courses/design/overview-description.html),
   along with one example exercise similar to [these examples](../courses/design/exercises-examples.html).
   (We strongly prefer plain text formatted as Markdown,
   but will accept PDFs as well if you need to include graphics to showcase your ideas.)

4. If you want to create a project,
   create a Jupyter Notebook that has a short description designed to entice learners
   and a couple of short code fragments to show what learners will do,
   similar to [the examples given here](../projects/projects-process.html#projects-writing-specification).

5. Email your idea to FIXME.
   Please include a one- or two-sentence description of yourself
   and links to your personal website or your LinkedIn profile.
   Please also include a one- or two-sentence summary of the idea
   and anything we ought to know about its history:
   have you used it in a course or workshop you've taught before?
   Did you create it as homework for a course you took?
   And are there any restrictions on the use of the code or data?

We will respond as quickly as our workload allows (usually within two weeks),
and will treat all proposals as confidential unless and until we have your permission to do otherwise.
