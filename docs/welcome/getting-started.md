While you can also read the upcoming sections which are going to guide you through the process of creating the necessary accounts.

## DataCamp Account

Creating a DataCamp account is a straightforward process. Visit [www.datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/) and enter your credentials.

Once you have created your DataCamp account you can proceed with creating your Github Account.

## Github Account

DataCamp uses Github as platform for hosting, versioning and collaborating on content.  
In case you are not familiar with Git we highly recommend you to take the [official Github tutorial](https://try.github.io).

Now that you are more familiar with Git you can proceed with creating your Github account.

### Creating the new account
To create a new account visit [Github registration](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) and complete three steps process.

The first step is providing login information:

Fill in all the required fields being:
- Username
- Email
- Password

Then click "Create new account" button to proceed to the next step.

As a part of second step you will need to choose the Github plan:

> #### info::Note
> _Paid plan is preferred if you are going to create content which needs to be private, meaning non accessible by other Github users_

We recommend you to start with the _Unlimited Plan_ and upgrade at later stage when and if it becomes necessary.

The last step is completing your Github registration.

There is no need to provide answers to any of the fields. You can proceed with clicking on "Submit" button in order to complete your Github account registration.
