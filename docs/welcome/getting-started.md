# Getting started

In order to start creating courses, challenges and/or projects on the DataCamp platform you need to have a DataCamp account and a GitHub account. For courses and challenges (but not projects) you also need to authorize DataCamp to manage your GitHub account.

The remainder of this page will walk you step-by-step through the setup process.

## Create a DataCamp account

If you don't already have a DataCamp account, visit [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/), enter your email address, and choose a password. You can also log in using your LinkedIn, Facebook, or Google+ account.

Once you have created your DataCamp account you can proceed with creating your GitHub account.

## Create a GitHub Account

DataCamp uses GitHub behind the scenes for hosting, versioning, and collaborating on content. In case you're not familiar with Git (the version control technology behind GitHub) we highly recommend you check out the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) or our [Introduction to Git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) course on DataCamp!

### Creating the new account

To create a new account visit the [GitHub registration](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) page and complete the three steps process.

The first step is providing your login information. Fill in all three required fields, then click the "Create an account" button to proceed.

Next, choose your plan. We recommend you start with the free plan and upgrade later if necessary.

You can skip the final step or fill in your details if desired.

## Link DataCamp and GitHub

Finally, you need to allow the DataCamp application to access your GitHub account so you can take full advantage of our authoring tools. Follow these steps to provide authorization:

1. Visit [datacamp.com/teach](https://www.datacamp.com/teach)
2. Click on the "Link GitHub Account" button

3. When promoted by GitHub, click the "Authorize" button
4. Once authorization is complete you will see your Teach dashboard

Now you're ready to start creating content!
